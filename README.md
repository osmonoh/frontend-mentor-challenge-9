# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks


This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges), a very nice website for practicing skills for learners of frontend technologies. I spend a decent amount of time on these when I was learning CSS, SASS and principles of responsive design. I absolutely loved doing them! 


So this is the design you aspire to achieve (and under is the challenge explained a little more):

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
